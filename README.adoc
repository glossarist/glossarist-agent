== Purpose

The Glossarist Agent is a Ruby gem designed to retrieve remotely located concepts.

Currently, it allows the bulk retrieval of the IHO S-32 Hydrographic Dictionary
into the Glossarist format.


== Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'glossarist-agent'
----

And then execute:

[source,shell]
----
$ bundle install
----

Or install it yourself as:

[source,shell]
----
$ gem install glossarist-agent
----


== Usage

=== Downloading IHO S-32 Hydrographic Dictionary data

==== General

The Glossarist Agent can download and process IHO (International Hydrographic
Organization) S-32 Hydrographic Dictionary data from available CSV files.

The official site is located at:

* http://iho-ohi.net/S32/

The Glossarist dataset incorporates all available languages, including:

* English
* French
* Spanish
* Chinese
* Indonesian

NOTE: If additional languages become available, minor code change is needed.

Glossarist Agent uses a caching mechanism to efficiently manage downloads and
reduce unnecessary network requests.

To retrieve these concepts and generate a Glossarist dataset, use the following
command:

[source,shell]
----
$ glossarist-agent iho retrieve-concepts
----

This command performs the following actions:

. Downloads the required CSV files from IHO sources.
. Caches the downloaded files for future use.
. Processes the CSV data to generate a Glossarist-compatible dataset.

==== Command Options

[source,shell]
----
$ glossarist-agent iho help retrieve-concepts
Usage:
  glossarist-agent iho retrieve-concepts

Options:
  -o, [--output=OUTPUT]                        # Directory to output generated files
                                               # Default: ./output
  -c, [--cache=CACHE]                          # Directory to store cached files
                                               # Default: ~/.glossarist-agent/cache
      [--fetch], [--no-fetch], [--skip-fetch]  # Fetch new data (default: true)
                                               # Default: true

Download IHO CSV files and generate concepts
----

`--output`:: Specifies the directory where the generated Glossarist dataset will be saved. Default is `./output`.
`--cache`:: Sets the directory for storing cached files. Default is `~/.glossarist-agent/cache`.
`--fetch`:: Controls whether to fetch new data or use existing cached data. Default is `true`.

[example]
====
The following command saves the IHO S-32 Glossarist dataset at
`./iho-s32-glossarist` and prioritizes using the existing cache without
communicating with the server.

[source,sh]
----
$ glossarist-agent iho retrieve-concepts --no-fetch -o iho-s32-glossarist
----

=== Caching mechanism

The Glossarist Agent employs a sophisticated caching system to optimize
performance and reduce unnecessary downloads:

. Downloaded files are stored in the specified cache directory.
. Each cached file is associated with metadata, including the download time and ETag.
. When fetching data, the agent checks:
.. If the cached file exists and is within the expiry period (default 7 days).
.. If the server's ETag matches the cached ETag.
. If either condition is not met, the agent downloads a fresh copy of the file.

This approach ensures that the agent always works with up-to-date data while minimizing network usage.

=== Generating Glossarist Dataset

After downloading and caching the IHO CSV files, the agent processes the data to generate a Glossarist-compatible dataset:

. It parses the CSV files to extract concept information.
. The extracted data is transformed into the Glossarist data model.
. The resulting dataset is saved in the specified output directory.

This generated dataset can then be used with other Glossarist tools for further processing or integration into concept management systems.

== Features

* Automated downloading and caching of IHO CSV files
* ETag-based cache validation
* Customizable cache expiry period
* Generation of Glossarist-compatible datasets from IHO data
* Command-line interface for easy integration into workflows

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`.
